      <b>Jolokia</b> is remote JMX with JSON over HTTP.<br />
      
<div class="subtitle">It is fast, simple, polyglot and has unique features. 
      It's JMX on <a class="externalLink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsaicin">Capsaicin</a>.</div>
    </div>
    
<p>
      Jolokia is a JMX-HTTP bridge giving an alternative to JSR-160
      connectors.  It is an agent based approach with support for many
      platforms. In addition to basic JMX operations it enhances JMX
      remoting with unique features like bulk requests and fine grained
      security policies.

          Meh, that was a busy summer. Apologies for the delay and
          breaking the usual one-release-per-month cycle.
        </p>
        
<p>
          Nevertheless there are some nice goodies in this release:
        </p>
        
<ul>
          
<li>
            SSL handling of the JVM agent has been fixed and
            improved. Authentication with client certificates works
            now and you have much more influence of the SSL
            setup. Kudos to <a class="externalLink" href="https://github.com/nevenr">Neven Radovanovi&#x107;</a> for
            providing a patch.
          </li>
          
<li>
            The Mule agent has been updated to support Mule
            3.5. Thanks to <a class="externalLink" href="https://github.com/FeiWongReed">Fei Wong Reed</a>
            for the pull request.
          </li>
          
<li>
            The configuration option &quot;policyLocation&quot; has now system
            property and environment expansions. 
          </li>
          
<li>
            Quite a bunch of bugs has been fixed. Please refer to the
            <a href="changes-report.html">changes report</a> for all
            changes. 
          </li>
        </ul>
        
<p>
          If you want to get a quick introduction into Jolokia and a
          peek preview to Jolokia 2.0 come to my &quot;Tools in Action&quot;

          Last announcement for now: I started a blog at <a class="externalLink" href="https://ro14nd.de">https://ro14nd.de</a> about
          various technical topics like Jolokia, Docker or other
          stuff.

<div class="news-date">2014-06-14</div>
        
<p>
          Let's welcome Jolokia's next minor release which is not <i>so</i>
          minor as it might seems. 
        </p>
        
<ul>
          
<li>
            Custom authenticator support for the Java client. The
            standard authenticator allows preemptive authentication now
            as well.
          </li>
          
<li>
            Support for &quot;*&quot; wildcard in paths. See below.
          </li>
          
<li>
            Finally an update to json-simple-1.1.1 which is mavenized,
            but still has its issues and not much traction to fix
            it. No problem we have a good workaround and it is still
            rock solid. 
          </li>
          
<li>
            Bug fixes. Yep.
          </li>
        </ul>
        
<p>
          The biggest new feature with the most impact is path
          wildcard support. You probably know <a href="reference/html/protocol.html#read">pattern read
          requests</a> which allow for fetching multiple patterns by
          using patterns for MBean names and attributes (not to be
          confused with <a href="reference/html/protocol.html#post-request">bulk
          requests</a>). When using pattern read requests, the value
          in the returned JSON structure is not a single return value
          for an attribute but a more complex structure containing the
          full MBean names and attributes which are matched by the
          pattern. Of course, it is not easy to use a path to navigate
          on this structure, the path has to know the full
          MBean name (well, why using a pattern then ?). That's the main
          reason why path access was not supported for pattern read
          requests up to release 1.2.1
        </p>
        
<p>
          Starting with 1.2.2 it is possible to use &quot;*&quot; wildcards in
          patterns, which match a complete 'level' in the JSON
          object. This makes it easy to fetch all same-named
          attributes on arbitrary MBeans and extract only parts of
          their values. In fact, it is not so easy explain wildcard
          pathes, but here is a try (another try can be found in the <a href="reference/html/protocol.html#read">reference manual</a>):
        </p>
        
<ul>
          
<li>
            If using a literal path, then everything works as expected:
            The value the path points to is returned. Mostly this is a
            scalar value because that is what paths was introduced for.
          </li>
          
<li>
            If the path contains a single &quot;*&quot; as a part, then when
            coming to <i>this level</i> everything is included. A
            path containing a wildcard cannot be a scalar anymore, but
            is a JSON object or array. The remaining path parts are
            included as described above to each element at this level.
          </li>
          
<li>
            A path can contain multiple wildcards, but wildcards can
            be used only on its own. If a &quot;*&quot; is used as part of a
            path part (like 'current*'), it's taken literally (which
            most of the time doesn't make much sense). This might
            change in the future.            
          </li>
          
<li>
            The net effect is, that literal path parts are &quot;squeezed&quot;
            (i.e. removed) in the resulting answer, whereas wildcard
            parts stay as extra levels. 
          </li>
        </ul>
        
<p>
          You see, wildcard path handling is somewhat complex. For
          pattern read request they make quite some sense, for all
          other requests, I couldn't find good use cases yet. Please
          open an issue if any suspicious behaviour during
          path-wildcard using occurs.
        </p>
        
<p>
          Finally, I would also like to mention a new GitHub project
          <a class="externalLink" href="https://github.com/rhuss/jolokia-extra">jolokia-extra</a>
          which holds additional goodies. One design goal of Jolokia
          is to keep it focused. That's not so easy as there are tons
          of ideas out there, all backed by a particular use case. And
          they all want to get into the game. Beside that someone has
          to implement that (hint: still looking for contributions ;-), I
          opened a new playground for all that stuff which might not
          be of general interest but are still pearls. That's what
          <tt>jolokia-extra</tt> is for.
        </p>
        
<p>
          The beginning makes a 1.5 year old <a class="externalLink" href="https://github.com/rhuss/jolokia/pull/50">pull
          request</a> from <a class="externalLink" href="https://github.com/mplonka">Marcin
          P&#x142;onka</a> (Thanks a lot and sorry for the long, long delay,
          BTW). It's all about simplifying access to JSR-77 enabled
          JEE-Servers. You should know that <a class="externalLink" href="https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=77">JSR 77: J2EE
          Management</a> was a cool attempt to standardize naming and
          JMX exposed metrics for JEE. Unfortunately it was abandoned,
          but still lives in quite a bunch of JEE servers. Not at its
          full beauty, but still valuable enough to be
          supported. Astonishingly, WebSphere, even the latest 8.5
          versions, has the best support for it. Using JSR-77 conform
          MBeans with plain Jolokia returns unnecessarily complex JSON
          structures which are hard to parse and
          understand. <tt>jolokia-extra</tt> adds a set of
          simplifier for make the usage with JSR-77 simpler (but add
          an extra of 50k to the agent). I recommend to have a look at it,
          especially if you are working with WebSphere.
        </p>
        
<p>
          In the future, it might be the case, that some lesser used
          additions (Spring and Spring Roo integration, JBoss Forge
          support, ...) will go into <tt>jolokia-extra</tt> as well. 
        </p>
        
<p>
          Enough blubber, enjoy this release. And just in case, if
          anybody is wondering about 2.0 (BTW, is there
          <b>anyone</b> out there carrying about this next
          generation JMX transcended super-hero ?), just drop a note
          with twitter (<a class="externalLink" href="https://twitter.com/jolokia_jmx">@jolokia_jmx</a>) or
          mail (<a class="externalLink" href="mailto:2.0@jolokia.org">2.0@jolokia.org</a>).

<h3><a name="a1.2.1_is_in_the_house"></a>1.2.1 is in the house</h3>
        
<div class="news-date">2014-04-29</div>
        
<p>
          This minor release fixes some bugs and brings some <a href="changes-report.html">smaller features</a>:
        </p>
        
<ul>
          
<li>An ActiveMQ server detector has been added</li>
          
<li>
            The Java client library has been updated to the latest Apache HTTP components 4.x.
            If you are forced to still use Apache HTTP Client 3.x, you still can use the Java Client Lib from
            Jolokia 1.2.0 which will work with a Jolokia agent 1.2.1 nicely.</li>
          
<li>Bug fix for JBoss 4.2.3 (yeah, seems still to be used)</li>
          
<li>Cleaned up logging for discovery requests</li>
          
<li>Placeholders can be used when specifying the agent URL which will be used in discovery responses.
            That way you can configure the URL flexibly from you server configuration.
          </li>
        </ul>
        
<p>
          And finally there is an important addition to the configuration of Jolokia's access policy. You might know,
          that you can configure CORS so the agent allows access only from certain origins. CORS is used by browsers for
          cross origin sharing and is a pure client side check. I.e. the browser asks the server and if the server
          says &quot;no&quot; the browser forbids any Ajax request to this server from any script. However, this still allows
          non-Ajax requests from any origin. To restrict this, too, a new configuration directive <tt>&lt;strict-checking&gt;</tt>
          has been added to the <tt>&lt;cors&gt;</tt> section which, if given, will do also a server-side check of
          a <tt>Origin:</tt> header when provided by the browser. If a security policy is used, it is highly recommended to
          set this flag (which for compatibility reason is switched off by default). And yes, it is of course highly
          recommended to use a <a href="reference/html/security.html#security-policy">jolokia-access.xml</a> policy in production
          (and not only for servers exposed to the bad internet directly). This is especially important if you can access
          Jolokia agents directly via a browser which is also used for internet access
          (hint: <a class="externalLink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery">CSRF</a>).
        </p>
        
<p>
          No news about 2.0 ? Yes, indeed. The giant is still sleeping, &quot;Jolokia forever&quot;, you know. But the
          pressure rises, for some conferences I have some CFPs out which hopefully will lead to some nice CDD sessions
          (&quot;conference driven development&quot;, yeah).
        </p>

<h3><a name="Find_your_agents_with_1.2.0"></a>Find your agents with 1.2.0</h3>
        
<div class="news-date">2014-02-24</div>
        
<p>
          New year, new release. Ok, it's not the BIG 2.0 which I already somewhat promised. Anyways,
          another big feature jumped on the 1.x train in the last minute. It is now possible to find agents in your network by sending
          an UDP packet to the multicast group 239.192.48.84, port 24884. Agents having this discovery mechanism enabled
          will respond with their meta data including the access URL. This is especially
          useful for clients who want to provide access to agents without much configuration. I.e.
          the excellent <a class="externalLink" href="http://hawt.io">hawt.io</a> will probably use it one way or the other. In fact, it was hawt.io
          which put me <a class="externalLink" href="https://github.com/rhuss/jolokia/pull/126">on track</a> for this nice little feature ;-)
        </p>
        
<p>
          Discovery is enabled by default for the <a href="reference/html/agents.html#agents-jvm">JVM agent</a>, but not for
          the <a href="reference/html/agents.html#agents-war">WAR</a> agent.
          It can be easily enabled for the WAR agent by using servlet init parameters, system properties or environment variables.
          All the nifty details can be found in the <a href="reference/html/index.html">reference manual</a>.
        </p>
        
<p>
          The protocol for the discovery mechanism is also <a href="reference/html/protocol.html#discovery">specified</a> in the reference manual. One of the first clients
          supporting this discovery mode is <a class="externalLink" href="http://search.cpan.org/~roland/jmx4perl/lib/JMX/Jmx4Perl.pm">Jmx4Perl</a> in its newest version. The Jolokia
          Java client will follow in one of the next minor releases.
        </p>
        
<p>
          But you don't need client support for multicast requests if you know already the URL for one agent. Each
          agent registers a MBean <tt>jolokia:type=Discovery</tt> which perform the multicast discovery request for
          you if you trigger the operation <tt>lookupAgents</tt>. The returned value contains the agent information
          and is described <a href="reference/html/mbeans.html#mbean-discovery">here</a>.
        </p>
        
<p>
          This feature has been tested in various environments, but since low level networking can be, well, &quot;painful&quot;, I would
          ask you to open an <a class="externalLink" href="https://github.com/rhuss/jolokia/issues">issue</a> in case of any problems.
        </p>
        
<p>
          Although it has been quiet some time with respect to the shiny new Jolokia 2.0, I'm quite close to a first
          milestone. All planned features has been implemented in an initial version, what's missing is to finish the heavy
          refactoring and modularisation of the Jolokia core. More on this later, please stay tuned ...

<div class="news-date">2013-11-08</div>
        
<p>
          This is by far the smallest release ever: A <a class="externalLink" href="https://github.com/rhuss/jolokia/commit/98e62c0478b166d188e0c9f173b278a59eed1fc8#diff-cdf118c56620542b85bc48650eb8ddb6R162">single char</a>
          has been added on top of 1.1.4 fixing a silly bug when
          using Glassfish with the AMX system. So, no need to update if you are not using Glassfish.
        </p>
        
<p>
          Next week is Devoxx time and as last year (and the years before) you have the change to meet <a class="externalLink" href="https://twitter.com/ro14nd">me</a> in
          Antwerp. Ping me or look for the guy with the <a class="externalLink" href="http://jolokia.spreadshirt.de/men-s-hooded-jacket-A17809556/">Jolokia hoodie</a> ;-)

<div class="news-date">2013-09-27</div>
        
<p>
          Some bug fixes and two new features has been included for the <a href="changes-report.html">autumn release</a>:
        </p>
        
<p>
          A new configuration parameter &quot;<tt>authenticatorClass</tt>&quot; can be used for the JVM agent to specify an
          alternate authentication handler in addition to the default one (which simply checks for user and password).
        </p>
        
<p>
          With the configuration parameter &quot;<tt>logHandlerClass</tt>&quot; an alternative log handler can be specified. This can
          be used for the WAR and JVM agent in order to tweak Jolokia's logging behaviour. For the OSGi agent you already
          could use a <tt>LogService</tt> for customizing logging.
        </p>
        
<p>
          That's it and I hope you enjoy this release. I know, I'm late with 2.0, but as things happens, I have too
          much to do in 'real life' (i.e. feeding my family ;-). But I still hope to get it out this year, and yes, the
          2.0 branch is growing (slowly).

          BTW, the slides to my talk for the small but very fine <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.jayday.de">JayDay 2013</a> are <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.jolokia.org/jayday-2013">online</a>, too.
          These are &quot;implemented&quot; in JavaScript including live demos, where the JavaScript can be directly inserted

<div class="news-date">2013-05-28</div>
        
<p>
          In order to ease waiting for 2.0, Jolokia version 1.1.2 has been released. It contains some minor
          bug fixes as explained in the <a href="changes-report.html">changelog</a>. Depending on the bug reports and
          pull request dropping in there might be even a 1.1.3 release before 2.0 will be finished.
        </p>
        
<p>
          In the meantime, you can also see Jolokia live at <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.jayday.de/">JayDay</a> where I will give a talk about
          Jolokia's JavaScript support. The forthcoming JMX notification support will presented, too. It is also

<div class="news-date">2013-03-27</div>
        
<p>
          This last feature release before work on 2.0.0 starts brings
          some small goodies.  
        </p>
        
<ul>
          
<li>
            <tt>BigDecimal</tt> and <tt>BigInteger</tt> can
            now be used for operation arguments and return values.
          </li>
          
<li>
            A new processing parameter <a href="reference/html/protocol.html#processing-parameters"><tt>ifModifiedSince</tt></a>
            has been introduced. This parameter can be used with a
            timestamp for fetching the list of available MBeans only
            when there has been some changes in the MBean registration
            on any observed MBeanServer since that time. If there has
            been no changes an answer with status code &quot;302&quot; (Not
            modified) is returned. This feature is also supported for
            &quot;search&quot; requests. In a future version of Jolokia, there
            will be also custom support for own &quot;read&quot; and &quot;exec&quot;
            request so that expensive operations can be called
            conditionally. 
          </li>
          
<li>
            For the JVM agent, if a port of 0 is given, then an
            arbitrary free port will be selected and printed out on
            standard output as part of the Jolokia agent URL. If no
            host is given, the JVM agent will now bind to localhost
            and if host of &quot;0.0.0.0&quot; or &quot;*&quot; is provided, the agent
            will bind on all interfaces.
          </li>
          
<li>
            For the Java client an extra property
            <tt>errorValue</tt> has been added which holds the
            JSON serialized exception if the processiong parameter
            <tt>serializeException</tt> is active.
          </li>
          
<li>
            The JavaScript client's <a href="reference/html/clients.html#js-poller"><tt>jolokia.register()</tt></a>
            can now take an optional <tt>config</tt> element for
            specifying processing parameters for a certain scheduler
            job. Also, the new option <tt>onlyIfModified</tt> can
            be used so that the callback for list and search request
            is only called, if the set of registered MBean has
            changed. This is especially useful for web based client
            which want to refresh the MBean tree only if there are
            changes.
          </li>
          
<li>
            The <tt>Expires:</tt> header of a Jolokia response
            has now a valid date as value (instead of '-1') which
            points to one hour in the past. This change should help
            clients which do not ignore according to RFC-2616 invalid
            date syntax and treat them as 'already expired'.
          </li>
        </ul>
        
<p>
          Links to the corresponding GitHub issues and the bugs fixed
          in this release can be found in the <a href="changes-report.html">change report</a>.
        </p>
        
<p>
          This is the last feature release in the 1.x series. Work has
          already started on exciting new features for Jolokia
          2.0. E.g. JMX notification support is coming, an initial
          pull model has been already implemented (on branch <a class="externalLink" href="https://github.com/rhuss/jolokia/tree/notification">notification</a>). There
          are even more ideas and some refactorings will happening
          along with some modest changes in the module structure. So,
          please stay tuned ...
        </p>

<div class="section">
<h3><a name="a1.1.0_with_Spring_support_and_JsonMBean"></a>1.1.0 with Spring support and @JsonMBean</h3>
        
<div class="news-date">2013-02-26</div>
        
<p>
          It took some time, but it was worth it. Along with the usual bug fix parade,
          several new features has been added to Jolokia.
        </p>
        
<p>
          A new module <tt>jolokia-spring</tt> has been added which makes integration of Jolokia in
          Spring applications even easier. Simply add the following line (along with the corresponding namespace) to you
          application context and agent will be fired up during startup:
        </p>
        
<div>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-xml">&lt;jolokia:agent&gt;
   &lt;jolokia:config
           autoStart=&quot;true&quot;
           host=&quot;0.0.0.0&quot;
           port=&quot;8778&quot;
   ....
   /&gt;
&lt;/jolokia:agent&gt;</pre></div>
        
<p>
          More details can be found here in the <a href="reference/html/jmx.html#jvm-spring">reference manual</a>.
        </p>
        
<p>
          The new <tt>jolokia-jmx</tt> module provides an own
          MBeanServer which never gets exposed via JSR-160
          remoting. By registering your MBeans at the Jolokia
          MBeanServer you can make them exclusively available for
          Jolokia without worrying about JSR-160 access e.g. via
          <tt>jconsole</tt>. However, if you annotate your MBeans
          with <tt>@JsonMBean</tt> and register it at the Jolokia
          MBeanServer your get automatic translation of complex data
          types to JSON even for JSR-160 connections:
        </p>
        
<div>
          <img src="images/jconsole-json-mbean.png" alt="" />
        </div>
        
<p>
          The details can be found <a href="reference/html/jmx.html">here</a>.
        </p>
        
<p>
          Several new processing options enter the scene. These can be
          given either as global configuration parameters or as query
          parameters:
        </p>
        
<ul>
          
<li><b>canonicalNaming</b> influences the order of key properties in object names</li>
          
<li><b>serializeExceptions</b> adds a JSON representation of exceptions in an error case</li>
          
<li><b>includeStackTrace</b> can switch on/off the sending of an lengthy stack trace in an error case</li>
        </ul>
        
<p>
          That's it for now, all changes are summarized as always in the <a href="changes-report.html">change report</a>.
        </p>
        
<p>Some other, more organizational stuff for now:</p>

            Bugtracking and feature requests switch over completely to <a class="externalLink" href="https://github.com/rhuss/jolokia/issues">Github</a>.
            Since I'm currently collecting features for 2.0, it's a good time for feature requests ;-). All ideas entered
            at <a class="externalLink" href="http://jolokia.idea.informer.com/">jolokia.idea.informer.com</a> has been transformed into Github issues.

            If you are close to Germany it might be of interest to you, that I'm giving a training on Jolokia and Jmx4Perl,
            with focus on Java Monitoring with Nagios. This will happen at 16./17.04.2013 in Munich, details can be
            found on our <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.consol.de/open-source-monitoring/schulungen/java-monitoring-mit-nagios/">web site</a>
            (in german).

          And finally a very <b>hot</b> recommendation: Please have a look at <a class="externalLink" href="http://hawt.io">hawt.io</a> a super cool
          HTML5 console which uses Jolokia for backend communication exclusively. Most of the new ideas included in this
          Jolokia release were inspired by discussions with James Strachan, one of the driving forces behind hawt. Thanks for that ;-)

          Although it has been quite calm in Jolokia land for some
          months, there is quite some momentum around Jolokia. This
          minor release brings some cosmetic changes, mostly for
          tuning the ordering within MBeans names and some JavaScript
          fixes. More on this in the <a href="changes-report.html">changelog</a>.

<li>The new <a href="talks.html">Talks and Screencast</a> section collects some fancy multimedia introducing Jolokia</li>
          
<li>I'm going to talk about Jolokia at <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.jayday.de/?lang=en">jayday 2012</a>, a brand new, low cost
          conference in Munich on 3th December 2012. Hopefully there will be some brand new stuff to show, too.</li>

            The shop was too easy to setup for not doing it ;-) And they look freaking hot .... </li>

<div class="news-date">2012-07-22</div>
        
<p>
          Jolokia 1.0.5 has been released. Beside minor <a href="changes-report.html">improvements and bug fixes</a>,
          one great new feature has been introduced: As already
          mentioned Jolokia has now support for <a class="externalLink" href="http://square.github.com/cubism/">Cubism</a>, a fine
          time series charting library based on <a class="externalLink" href="http://d3js.org/">d3.js</a>. Cubism provides
          support for an innovative charting type, the <a class="externalLink" href="http://vis.berkeley.edu/papers/horizon/">horizon
          charts</a>:

        </div>
        
<p>
          A very cool live demo where a Jolokia JavaScript client
          fetches live data from our servers and plot it with Cubism
          can be found on this <a href="client/javascript-cubism.html">demo page</a>.
          The documentation can be found in the <a href="reference/html/clients.html#js-cubism">reference manual</a>.
        </p>
        
<p>
          Jolokia uses also a <a class="externalLink" href="http://travis-ci.org/#!/rhuss/jolokia">Travis</a>
          build in addition to our own <a class="externalLink" href="http://labs.consol.de/jenkins">CI Server</a>. (Did I
          mentioned already, that we have a quite I high <a class="externalLink" href="http://labs.consol.de/sonar/dashboard/index/org.jolokia:jolokia">Sonar</a> score
          ?). Travis is a quite nice supplement to Github, and brings CI
          testing to a higher level.
        </p>
        
<p>
          That's it for now. The next months of my open-source work
          will be spent now on <a class="externalLink" href="https://github.com/rhuss/aji">Aj&#xed;</a>, Jolokia's new
          fancy sister. Sorry for pushing thinks like notifications
          down the Jonlokia back-log, but it's not forgotten.
