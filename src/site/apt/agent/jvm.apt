JVM Agent

  Jolokia has also a native Java JVM agent. The only dependency is on
  Oracle's JDK 6 or later, which contains a lightweight HTTP Server used for
  exporting the jolokia protocol. This is the most generic agent which can
  instrument <any> Java application using a JDK6. It is suitable for
  situations where the other agents don't fit.

  For using this agent, the following argument to the Java
  application to instrument has to be given:

-----
  -javaagent:/path/to/jolokia-jvm-jdk6-<version>-agent.jar
-----

  By default, the agent will listen on port 8778, but this can be configured
  as well as other aspects like authentication:

  * Provide options on the commandline as key-value pairs:

----
  -javaagent:agent.jar=port=7777,host=localhost
----

  * Via a properties file

----
  -javaagent:agent.jar=config=/path/to/config.properties
----

  * Via packaging a jolokia-agent.properties top level in the agent.jar

  []

  Options are used in the given precedence, the former overwriting
  the later values.
